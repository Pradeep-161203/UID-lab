Aim:
  To Create a calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations using React's state management.
Description
A calculator application in React can be built using state management with the useState hook. The calculator has a display screen
and buttons for digits (0–9), operators (+, −, ×, ÷), and utility keys (C for clear, = for evaluation). Each time a user clicks a button,
the input is updated and stored in the component’s state. When the = button is pressed, React evaluates the expression using the stored state
and updates the display with the result. This approach ensures that the UI updates instantly whenever the state changes, making the
calculator interactive and responsive.
Coding:
import Calculator from '../components/Calculator';

function CalculatorPage() {
  return (
    <div className="page">
      <div className="container">
        <h1 className="page-title">Calculator</h1>
        <p className="page-description">
          A fully functional calculator built with React state management. 
          Demonstrates useState hooks for managing calculator state including display, 
          operations, and calculations.
        </p>
        
        <div className="calculator-page-content">
          <div className="calculator-section">
            <Calculator />
          </div>
          
          <div className="calculator-features">
            <h2>Features</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, ×, ÷)</li>
              <li>Decimal point support</li>

export default CalculatorPage;
Result
A working calculator that lets the user input numbers, perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and view results on the display screen.
