Aim:
  To Create a weather application that displays the weather forecast for a specific location.
Description
A weather application in React can be built by combining state management and API integration.
The app has an input field where the user types a city name and clicks a search button. React then sends a request to a weather
API (like OpenWeatherMap) to fetch real-time weather data. The response is stored in the component’s state and displayed on the screen.
The app shows information such as temperature, weather condition (sunny, cloudy, rainy), humidity, and wind speed. React automatically
re-renders the UI whenever the state updates, so the forecast changes instantly when a new location is entered.
Coding:
import React, { useState } from "react";
import "./App.css";

function App() {
  const [city, setCity] = useState("");
  const [weather, setWeather] = useState(null);
  const API_KEY = "YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY"; // Replace with your API key

  const fetchWeather = async () => {
    if (!city) return;
    const response = await fetch(
      `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city}&units=metric&appid=${API_KEY}`
    );
    const data = await response.json();
    setWeather(data);
  };

  const handleInputChange = (e) => setCity(e.target.value);

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Weather App</h1>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={city}
        onChange={handleInputChange}
        placeholder="Enter city"
      />
      <button onClick={fetchWeather}>Search</button>

      {weather && weather.main ? (
        <div className="weather-info">
          <h2>{weather.name}</h2>
          <p>Temperature: {weather.main.temp}°C</p>
          <p>Condition: {weather.weather[0].main}</p>
          <p>Humidity: {weather.main.humidity}%</p>
          <p>Wind Speed: {weather.wind.speed} m/s</p>
        </div>
      ) : weather && weather.message ? (
        <p>{weather.message}</p>
      ) : null}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
Result
A weather app where the user enters a city name and sees the current temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed for that location.
